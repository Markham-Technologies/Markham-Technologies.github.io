8:T453,The Fusion is an incredibly simple car. It holds only a single CAN bus, unlike the higher trim varients. All components are connected to a 500k/bit HS-CAN without a gateway.
            
• The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) manages the engine and emissions functions. Peugeot designed the Duratorq 414, so there is a reasonable chance they had involvement with the PCM.
• The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) manages the real-time wheel speed and braking actuation.
• The Instrument Cluster (IPK) displays diagnostic, time, vehicle range, speedometer and tachometer data. That's it. No Radio information, no vehicle controls besides resetting the trip mileage. It's basic.
• The Radio (RADIO) plays music. It has no Bluetooth, call, cellular, climate control, or really any functionality besides playing music.
• The Body Control Module (BCM) manages diagnostics and vehicle response, and controls vehicle lighting, central locking, and possibly power windows.

This leaves a problem. All attack vectors must have physical access (unless you can do something really clever with AM/FM radio waves).
